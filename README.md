To use this facial recognition code, please follow these steps:
import cv2
import numpy as np
import mysql.connector

# Load the cascade classifier for face detection
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier("C:/Users/Admin/PycharmProjects/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml")

# Load the TensorFlow model for object recognition
model = keras.models.load_model("model.h5")

# Establish a connection to MySQL database
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="your_database"
)

# Create a cursor to interact with the database
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Retrieve the image from the database
query = "SELECT image FROM images WHERE image_id = %s"
image_id = 1  # Adjust this based on your image ID in the database
cursor.execute(query, (image_id,))
result = cursor.fetchone()
image_blob = result[0]

# Convert the image blob to numpy array
nparr = np.frombuffer(image_blob, np.uint8)

# Decode the numpy array to image
ref_img = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

# Initialize the webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # Rest of the code remains the same as before
    # ...

# Release the camera and close the window
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Close the database connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()


mysql.connector :   
mysql.connector library to establish a connection to a MySQL database. Make sure to replace the placeholders 'your_host', 'your_username', 'your_password', and 'your_database' with the actual connection details of your MySQL database.

Assuming you have a table named images in your database, the code retrieves the image blob from the database using a query. Modify the query to suit your database schema and table structure. The image ID is specified as image_id = 1 in this example, so adjust it based on the ID of the image you want to retrieve from the database.

The retrieved image blob is then converted to a NumPy array using np.frombuffer, and subsequently, the NumPy array is decoded to an OpenCV image using cv2.imdecode.

After that, you can continue with the rest of the code as before to perform face detection, object recognition, and image matching using the retrieved image.
